# Safe Data


 Python GUI program that stores your logins LOCALLY. Nothing is being sent to the cloud or any online database. The main inspiration behind this project was me getting fed up with large password storing companies getting breached and having to worry if my data got breached. 



## How to Install 

- Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) from here
- Download [source](https://github.com/ziadh/Safe-Data/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from here
- After unzipping the source file and navigating forward to where the main.py file is located, press on the address bar then type cmd.

Run the following command to download all the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When it is finished, close the cmd and simply double click the Safe-Data.pyw file.
