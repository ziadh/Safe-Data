# Safe Data - Beta Release


 Python GUI program that stores your logins LOCALLY. Nothing is being sent to the cloud or any online database. The main inspiration behind this project was me getting fed up with large password storing companies getting breached and having to worry if my data got breached. 

## How to Install 
After unzipping the .zip file and navigating forward to where the main.py file is located, press on the address bar then type cmd.

Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download all the required packages. When it is finished, run "pythonw main.py".

## What's to come?
- Better design: I am looking to improve the UI in the near future as well as add a toggle for a dark mode
- Possibly make it a taskbar widget for PC
- Probably a better project name, lol
- More ideas to come...
