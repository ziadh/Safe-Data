# Safe Data - 1.0 Release


 Python GUI program that stores your logins LOCALLY. Nothing is being sent to the cloud or any online database. The main inspiration behind this project was me getting fed up with large password storing companies getting breached and having to worry if my data got breached. 

Safe Data has now fully launched with a handful of new features!


## How to Install 
After unzipping the .zip file and navigating forward to where the main.py file is located, press on the address bar then type cmd.

Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download all the required packages.

When it is finished, close the cmd and simply double click the main.pyw file.

## Features
-Ability to generate a random hard-to-guess password and add it to your clipboard
