# Safe Data - Beta Release 0.50


 Python GUI program that stores your logins LOCALLY. Nothing is being sent to the cloud or any online database. The main inspiration behind this project was me getting fed up with large password storing companies getting breached and having to worry if my data got breached. 

This is the second beta of the program. I hope to launch with more features later this month or early January.


## How to Install 
After unzipping the .zip file and navigating forward to where the main.py file is located, press on the address bar then type cmd.

Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download all the required packages.

When it is finished, close the cmd and simply double click the main.pyw file.

## Features
-Ability to generate a random hard-to-guess password and add it to your clipboard

-Saves your logins LOCALLY to your machine. It does not upload it anywhere.

(Might add a lock function or an encryption function in the near future)
## What's to come?
- Toggle for light mode (if requested lol)
- Possibly make it a taskbar widget for PC
- Lock the data.txt file or make it saved as encrypted
- Add a button the program to clear all data with confirmation required
